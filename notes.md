## Introduction

## Tomorrow

- defining basics of pyproject.toml
- dynamic version?
- app vs library
- dependency groups
- optional dependencies
- versioning

## Basic

Import as unit of sharing
When you import, what happens

- test PyPI
- library vs app
- dependency specification
- dependency bounds
- ci/cd?

## Advanced
