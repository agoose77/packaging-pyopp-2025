subtitle:

## Goals

- To end this workshop with a Python package that can be published to PyPI
- To know about the important "standards" and "tools"
- To understand the difference between an _import_ package and _distribution_ package
- To understand _how_ Python finds importable code
- Thinking about _personas_ of your users

## Basic

- test PyPI
- library vs app
- dependency specification
- dependency bounds
- ci/cd?

## Advanced

- build plugins
- compiled code [rust, c++]
- conda-forge
- emscripten-forge?
