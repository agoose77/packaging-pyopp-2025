# The near past ...

- Before `pip` and PyPI`, people shared code by hand using `distutils`
- PyPI was then created, and `distutils` could upload to it
- `setuptools` then came along, and added a new `.egg` format
- `setuptools` introduced `easy_install` for _using_ PyPI
- `pip` and the `whl` format were introduced
