# How to Create a Distribution

Now that we know about the two different kinds of {term}`distribution package`, we should learn how to create them! We have already discussed that the main feature of a {term}`distribution package` is the _additional metadata_ like the author's contact details, and description. We will need to define this metadata so that it can be used to build the distribution. At this point, it is necessary to start talking about _packaging tools and standards_.
